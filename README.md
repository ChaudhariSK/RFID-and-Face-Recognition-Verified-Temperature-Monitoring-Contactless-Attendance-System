# RFID-and-Face-Recognition-based-attendance-system-
The institutions and organization generally use fingerprint recognition and signature-based attendance system to mark the attendance. The fingerprint recognition system is secure and reliable but in both the process user has to get in contact with the surface of the attendance system, which can cause the spread of viruses and bacteria among the people, for example, diseases like COVID-19, influenza and the common cold can spread through getting in contact with a contaminated surface. So, in the pandemic of COVID-19 and other future infections, uses of such systems are not feasible. For that, this paper presents the model which is secure, reliable and contactless. The model is consist of serially connected face recognition and Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) module for marking the attendance, Infrared thermal sensor for scanning body temperature and FAR Ultraviolet-C light container for self-sanitization of the complete module.
